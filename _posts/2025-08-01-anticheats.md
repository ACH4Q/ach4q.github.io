# Rootkits in Disguise? The Truth About Kernel Anti-Cheat Software

## The Double-Edged Sword of Anti-Cheat Systems

We all love video games—whether it's *Valorant*, *League of Legends*, or the punishing world of *Elden Ring*. And let’s be honest: who hasn’t at least *thought* about hacking a game to get infinite resources or god-like powers? But ding-dong—anti-cheat systems are waiting for you.  

So, I asked myself: **What exactly is an anti-cheat, and how does it work?**  

Turns out, there are two main types:  

### User-Level Anti-Cheats (Ring 3)  

These programs run in the background when you launch a game, with the same privileges as any normal application (like your web browser). Their job is to:  
- Scan game files for tampering.  
- Monitor player behavior.  
- Check running processes for cheat tools like *Cheat Engine* or debuggers.  

**Examples:** *Dota 2* or older versions of *CS:GO*.  

#### Pros:  
✅ **Less intrusive** – Doesn’t require deep system access.  
✅ **Lower security risk** – Can’t be easily exploited by malware.  

#### Cons:  
❌ **Easier for cheaters to bypass** – Many hacks run at kernel level.

### Kernel-Level Anti-Cheats (Ring 0)  

These are far more powerful—and far more invasive. They load at system boot, sometimes even before Windows itself, giving them unrestricted access to:  
- **All memory** (not just the game’s).  
- **Hardware devices** (USB, PCIe slots).  
- **Other drivers** (can block or modify them).  

**Examples:**  
- *Riot Vanguard* (**Valorant**) – Runs 24/7 unless uninstalled.  
- *BattlEye* (**Fortnite, PUBG**) – Blocks DMA cheats.  
- *Easy Anti-Cheat* (**Apex Legends, Elden Ring**) – HWID bans.  

#### Pros:  
✅ **Extremely effective** against advanced cheats (DMA, kernel drivers).  
✅ **Real-time detection** (instant bans).  

#### Cons:  
❌ **Acts like a true rootkit** – Full system control.  
❌ **Security risks** – A bug or zero-day could let hackers take over your PC.  
❌ **Privacy concerns** – Can scan *everything*, even unrelated processes.

## The Big Question: Is This a Fair Trade?  

### 1. They’re Literally Rootkits (But "Legal")  
   - By definition, a **rootkit** is malware that hides in the kernel.  
   - Anti-cheats do the same thing—just for "fair play."  
   - If hacked, they could become weapons (*spyware, ransomware*).  

### 2. History Shows They’re Not Perfect  
   - **BattlEye** had a zero-day exploit ([CVE-2019-12592](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12592)).  
   - **Vanguard** has had privilege escalation flaws.  
   - **EAC** can be bypassed via signed driver exploits.  

### 3. Do You Trust the Companies Behind Them?  
   - **Riot (Tencent-owned)** forces *Vanguard* to run 24/7.  
   - **Epic Games (BattlEye)** scans your system constantly.  
   - **No transparency**—what data do they *really* collect?

## Final Thought: Can We Have Both Fair Play *and* Privacy?  
Kernel anti-cheats work, but at what cost? Should gamers accept rootkit-like software as the price of a cheat-free experience? Or is there a better way?
